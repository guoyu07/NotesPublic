|! Caesar Encryption !|
Encrypt each letter (p) to the next k letter in alphabet. 
e.g. k = 3, lefz ==> ohjc

C = E(k, p) = (p + k) mod 26    /* C is the encrypted letter */
p = (C - k) mod 26              /* the formula to decrypt one letter */

Question:

Solution:
  Count the frequencies of each letter:
    X: 19
    M: 15
    T: 13
    G: 13
    B: 12
    H: 11
    E: 9
    L: 6
    A: 5
    W: 5
    F: 5
    K: 4
    N: 4
    U: 4
    V: 4
    Y: 4
    P: 2
    R: 2
    D: 2
    I: 1
    Z: 1
  The most common letters are {X M T G B H}. According to the frequencies of each letter in English words by LEWAOO, the encrypted {X T G M H B E} may be {e t a o i n s h}, and {I D Z} may be {b v k j x q z}
  X may be 'e' probably.
  There're still a lot of probabilities. We know that 'th' may be the most common part of a word. esp. 'the' 'that'... 
  Count the frequencies of two closed letters:
    GM: 6
    HG: 6
    XF: 4
    MA: 3
    ...
  'the' may be a very common word in English sentense.  
  Count the frequencies of three cloesed letters:
    HGM: 3        // GM must not be 'th', otherwise there'll be a lot of GM?
    ATM: 2
    BWH: 2
    BYX: 2
    EBY: 2
    MAX: 2       // this may be 'th', because above MA: 3
    TGB: 2
    UNM: 2
    VHG: 2
    XGM: 2
    XHG: 2
    XMA: 2
    ...
    So 'MAX' may be 'the',
  Let's fill into the sentence and guess,  'th t' may be `that`, 'T' may be 'a'.

  It'll still hard to guess the password out. Let's try Caesar Encryption.
  'm' = E(p, k) = (p + k) mod 26 = ('t' + 19) mod 26
  'a' = ('h' + 19) mod 26 ... 
  so parameter k must be 19, we'll get the sentence:
