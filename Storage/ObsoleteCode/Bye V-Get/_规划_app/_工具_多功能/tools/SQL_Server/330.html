<P style="FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, serif">Here is a 
small script that will perform maintenance on all databases on a SQL server. 
</P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, serif">The script 
looks at what databases are configured on the SQL Server then retrieves a list 
of tables for each DB on the SQL Server. The script then uses this list to 
perform DBCC DBREINDEX on each table in the DB. It also performs UPDATE 
STATISTICS on the table. When the script has finished re-indexing and updating 
the statistics on each table in the DB, it then performs a DBCC CHECKDB on the 
database. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, serif">The script 
then moves onto the next database on the SQL server until all databases have 
been maintained. </P>
<P style="FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, serif">The advantages 
of using this type of script is that the script doesn't need to be modified if 
tables, indexes or databases are added, altered or deleted. </P></FONT>
