<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>This article explains how to use Access 2000 date functions when determining 
1) the number of work days representing an interval between two dates, and 2) 
the projected end working date calculated from a start date and number of hours 
worked. 
<P>The user enters in a start date and actual hours as parameters in the 
GetEndWorkDay function. The function calculates the date in the future the work 
should be completed. So, if today is 12/2/2002 and the actual hours is 12, the 
projected end date would be 12/3/2002. 
<P>The second part uses the GetNumberOfWorkDays function to determine what 
percent of the estimated time actual time represents. Estimated work days is the 
time interval to complete a task based on a start and end date. Comparing 
estimated to actual time, we can provide the percent of work completed both 
under or over allocated percents.

<LI>DateAdd returns a date to which a specific time interval has been added. In 
this sample the interval is "Day".

<LI>Increment through a range of possible work days to find the end work date. 
The number of work days is determined by dividing the hours by eight. This 
assumes an eight hour work day. Ignore saturday and sunday as work days. Once 
the number of found work days equals the work day interval, stop and return the 
date as the final work date.

Sunday = 1 <BR>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Monday = 2 <BR>&nbsp;

<LI>First determine the number of days between the two dates. Calculating the 
number of work days is done by not adding Saturday and Sunday dates. A query 
extract from a table containing all the holidays for the year could also be 
added for increased accuracy. </LI></OL></FONT></FONT>
