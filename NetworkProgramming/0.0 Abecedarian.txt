/**
 * @see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-trip_delay_time
 */
the time for a signal(data packet) to be sent plus the time for an ACK to be received.
The RTT is also known as the ping time, using the ping command.
RTT = (C · Old_RTT) + ((1 − C) · New_Round_Trip_Sample)    0 ≤ C < 1

|- Mean Deviation[ˌdiviˈeʃən] -|
It is the mean of the distances between each value and the mean. It gives us an
idea of how spread out from the center the set of values is.

Example:
  Standard ping time to a server is 10.12ms, and get the test figures 
  9.90 10.4 11.2 11.2 12.6 with ping command.
  mdev = ((9.90 + 10.4 + 11.2 + 11.2 + 12.6) - (5 * 10.12)) / 5 = 0.94ms
