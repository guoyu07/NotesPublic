# IPv6 Packet Header
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6_packet

```
[MAC Header][IP Header][Data :::]
```

*   Version—Indicates the version of the Internet Protocol.
*   Traffic class—Previously the type-of-service (ToS) field in IPv4, the traffic class field defines the class-of-service (CoS) priority of the packet. However, the semantics for this field (for example, DiffServ code points) are identical to IPv4.
*   Flow label—The flow label identifies all packets belonging to a specific flow (that is, packet flows requiring a specific class of service [CoS]); routers can identify these packets and handle them in a similar fashion.
*   Payload length—Previously the total length field in IPv4, the payload length field specifies the length of the IPv6 payload.
*   Next header—Previously the protocol field in IPv4, the Next Header field indicates the next extension header to examine.
*   Hop limit—Previously the time-to-live (TTL) field in IPv4, the hop limit indicates the maximum number of hops allowed.
*   Source address—Identifies the address of the source node sending the packet.
*   Destination address—Identifies the final destination node address for the packet.

## Traffic Class (8 bits)
The bits of this field hold two values. The 6 most-significant bits are used for [differentiated services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiated_services), which is used to classify packets. The remaining two bits are used for [ECN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_Congestion_Notification) ; priority values subdivide into ranges: traffic where the source provides congestion control and non-congestion control traffic.
### Differentiated Services
Differentiated services or DiffServ is a computer networking architecture that specifies a simple, scalable and coarse-grained mechanism for classifying and managing network traffic and providing quality of service (QoS) on modern IP networks. DiffServ can, for example, be used to provide low-latency to critical network traffic such as voice or streaming media while providing simple best-effort service to non-critical services such as web traffic or file transfers.
