# cassandra.yaml
http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting_started/configuring.html

Most of configuration in Cassandra is done via yaml properties that can be set in cassandra.yaml. At a minimum you should consider setting the following properties:

* cluster_name: the name of your cluster.
* seeds: a comma separated list of the IP addresses of your cluster seeds.
* storage_port: you don¡¯t necessarily need to change this but make sure that there are no firewalls blocking this port.
* listen_address: the IP address of your node, this is what allows other nodes to communicate with this node so it is important that you change it. Alternatively, you can set listen_interface to tell Cassandra which interface to use, and consecutively which address to use. Set only one, not both.
* native_transport_port: as for storage_port, make sure this port is not blocked by firewalls as clients will communicate with Cassandra on this port.


# logback.xml
The logger in use is logback. You can change logging properties by editing logback.xml. By default it will log at INFO level into a file called system.log and at debug level into a file called debug.log. When running in the foreground, it will also log at INFO level to the console.
