    /dev/null   All data written to this device is discarded. A read from this device will return an EOF condition.
    /dev/zero   This device is a source of zeroed out data. All data written to this device is 
                discarded. A read from this device will return as many bytes containing the value 
                zero as was requested.
    /dev/tty    This device is a synonym for the controlling terminal of a process. Once this device
                is opened, all reads and writes will behave as if the actual controlling terminal

# /sbin
Utilities used for system administration (and other root-only commands) are stored in `/sbin`, `/usr/sbin`, and
`/usr/local/sbin`. 

`/sbin` contains binaries essential for booting, restoring, recovering, and/or repairing the
system in addition to the binaries in `/bin`.

Programs executed after `/usr` is known to be mounted (when there
are no problems) are generally placed into `/usr/sbin`. Locally-installed system administration programs
should be placed into `/usr/local/sbin`.

```

# /srv   Data for services provided by this system
This main purpose of specifying this is so that users may find the location of the data files for particular
service, and so that services which require a single tree for readonly data, writable data and scripts (such as
cgi scripts) can be reasonably placed. Data that is only of interest to a specific user should go in that users’
home directory.
The methodology used to name subdirectories of /srv is unspecified as there is currently no consensus on
how this should be done. One method for structuring data under /srv is by protocol, eg. ftp, rsync, www,
and cvs. On large systems it can be useful to structure /srv by administrative context, such as
/srv/physics/www, /srv/compsci/cvs, etc. This setup will differ from host to host. Therefore, no program
should rely on a specific subdirectory structure of /srv existing or data necessarily being stored in /srv.
However /srv should always exist on FHS compliant systems and should be used as the default location for
such data.
Distributions must take care not to remove locally placed files in these directories without administrator
permission.

# /usr
/usr is the second major section of the filesystem. /usr is shareable, read-only data. That means that /usr
should be shareable between various FHS-compliant hosts and must not be written to. Any information that is
host-specific or varies with time is stored elsewhere.

Large software packages must not use a direct subdirectory under the /usr hierarchy.

```
bin     Most user commands
include Header files included by C programs
lib     Libraries
local   Local hierarchy (empty after main installation)
sbin    Non-vital system binaries
share   Architecture-independent data
X11R6   XWindow System, version 11 release 6 (optional)
games   Games and educational binaries (optional)
lib<qual> Alternate Format Libraries (optional)
src     Source code (optional)
```
The following symbolic links to directories may be present. This possibility is based on the need to preserve
compatibility with older systems until all implementations can be assumed to use the /var hierarchy.
```
/usr/spool       -> /var/spool
/usr/tmp         -> /var/tmp
/usr/spool/locks -> /var/lock
```

## /usr/bin
```
perl    The Practical Extraction and Report Language (optional)
python  The Python interpreted language (optional)
tclsh   Simple shell containing Tcl interpreter (optional)
wish    Simple Tcl/Tk windowing shell (optional)
expect  Program for interactive dialog (optional)
```
Because shell script interpreters (invoked with #!<path> on the first line of a shell script) cannot rely on a
path, it is advantageous to standardize their locations. The Bourne shell and C-shell interpreters are already
fixed in /bin, but Perl, Python, and Tcl are often found in many different places. They may be symlinks to the
physical location of the shell interpreters.

## /usr/local
The /usr/local hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when installing software locally. It needs to
be safe from being overwritten when the system software is updated. It may be used for programs and data that
are shareable amongst a group of hosts, but not found in /usr.
Locally installed software must be placed within /usr/local rather than /usr unless it is being installed to
replace or upgrade software in `/usr` .
```
bin     Local binaries
etc     Host-specific system configuration for local binaries
games   Local game binaries
include Local C header files
lib     Local libraries
man     Local online manuals
sbin    Local system binaries
share   Local architecture-independent hierarchy
src     Local source code
```

If directories /lib<qual> or /usr/lib<qual> exist, the equivalent directories must also exist in
/usr/local.
/usr/local/etc may be a symbolic link to /etc/local

## /usr/share
The /usr/share hierarchy is for all read-only architecture independent data files.

Any program or package which contains or requires data that doesn’t need to be modified should store that data
in /usr/share (or /usr/local/share, if installed locally). It is recommended that a subdirectory be used in
/usr/share for this purpose.

## /usr/src
Source code may be place placed in this subdirectory, only for reference purposes. 


## /var/run
This directory contains system information data describing the system since it was booted. Files under this
directory must be cleared (removed or truncated as appropriate) at the beginning of the boot process. Programs
may have a subdirectory of /var/run; this is encouraged for programs that use more than one run-time file.
Process identifier (PID) files, which were originally placed in /etc, must be placed in /var/run. The naming
convention for PID files is <program-name>.pid, and for SOCK files is <program-name>.sock. For example, the crond PID file is named /var/run/crond.pid.

## /var/spool
/var/spool contains data which is awaiting some kind of later processing. Data in /var/spool represents
work to be done in the future (by a program, user, or administrator); often data is deleted after it has been
processed.
```
lpd     Printer spool directory (optional)
mqueue  Outgoing mail queue (optional)
news    News spool directory (optional)
rwho    Rwhod files (optional)
uucp    Spool directory for UUCP (optional)
```

## var/tmp
The /var/tmp directory is made available for programs that require temporary files or directories that are
preserved between system reboots. Therefore, data stored in /var/tmp is more persistent than data in /tmp.
Files and directories located in /var/tmp must not be deleted when the system is booted. Although data stored
in /var/tmp is typically deleted in a site-specific manner, it is recommended that deletions occur at a less
frequent interval than /tmp.
