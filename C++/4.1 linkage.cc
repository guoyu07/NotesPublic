/*
All static duration variables share the following initialization feature:An uninitialized
static variable has all its bits set to 0.Such a variable is said to be zero-initialized.

On the one hand, an external variable has to be declared in each file that uses the variable.
On the other hand, C++ has the ¡°one definition rule¡± (also known as odr), which states
that there can be only one definition of a variable.To satisfy these requirements, C++ has
two kinds of variable declarations. One is the defining declaration or, simply, a definition.It
causes storage for the variable to be allocated.The second is the referencing declaration or,
simply, a declaration. It does not cause storage to be allocated because it refers to an existing
variable.
A referencing declaration uses the keyword extern and does not provide initialization.
Otherwise, a declaration is a definition and causes storage to be allocated:

If you use an external variable in several files, only one file can contain a definition for
that variable (per the one definition rule). But every other file using the variable needs to
declare that variable using the keyword extern:
*/
    
// file01.cpp
int cats = 20;  // definition because of initialization
int dogs = 22;         // also a definition
int fleas;             // also a definition

// file02.cpp
// use cats and dogs from file01.cpp
extern int cats;       // not definitions because they use
extern int dogs;       // extern and have no initialization
...
// file98.cpp
// use cats, dogs, and fleas from file01.cpp
extern int cats;
extern int dogs;
extern int fleas;

/* 
In this case,all the files use the cats and dogs variables defined in file01.cpp.How-
ever,file02.cpp doesn¡¯t re-declare the fleas variable,so it can¡¯t access it.
