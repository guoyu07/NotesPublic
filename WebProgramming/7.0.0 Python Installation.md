# Not suggest replace system python
Because yum is based on python. If you want to replace `/usr/bin/python` to the new one(Not suggest), 
you have to replace the yum sources.

```
sh$ vim /usr/bin/yum
|[
#!/usr/bin/python2.7
]|

sh$ vim /usr/libexec/urlgrabber-ext-down
|[
#!/usr/bin/python2.7
]|
```
