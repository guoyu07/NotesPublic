Let's pretend we're building a web application. What are all web applications made of?
1) Templates / html = View
2) Data that will populate our views = Models
3) Logic to retrieve data, glue all views together and to react accordingly to user events,
   data modifications, etc. = Controller

This is the very classic MVC that we all know about. But it actually looks like concepts of flux,
just expressed in a slightly different way:
- Models look like stores
- user events, data modifications and their handlers look like
  "action creators" -> action -> dispatcher -> callback
- Views look like React views (or anything else as far as flux is concerned)
