# Codeception
*   Acceptance Tests :  mutate browser
*   Functional Tests :  get/post mutation
*   Unit Test        :  Model tests
## Install

Tests in `codeception` directory are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](http://codeception.com/).

After creating and setting up the advanced application, follow these steps to prepare for the tests:

1. Install Codeception if it's not yet installed:

   ```
   composer global require "codeception/codeception=2.0.*" "codeception/specify=*" "codeception/verify=*"
   ```

   If you've never used Composer for global packages run `composer global status`. It should output:

   ```
   Changed current directory to <directory>
   ```

   Then add `<directory>/vendor/bin` to you `PATH` environment variable. Now you're able to use `codecept` from command
   line globally.

2. Install faker extension by running the following from template root directory where `composer.json` is:

   ```
   composer require --dev yiisoft/yii2-faker:*
   ```
 
Or you can write these into composer.json

```
    "require": {
        ...
        "codeception/codeception": "2.0.*",
        "codeception/specify": "*",
        "codeception/verify": "*"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "yiisoft/yii2-codeception": "*",
        "yiisoft/yii2-faker": "*"
    }
```

确保yii2生成的时候使用develop环境，不然配置文件会没有 xx-local.php，那么此时需要逐一自己重建。

3. Create `yii2_advanced_tests` database then update it by applying migrations:

   ```
   codeception/bin/yii migrate
   ```

 如果出现 SQL错误，肯定是数据库配置问题
   
   
4. Build the test suites:

   ```
   ../vendor/codeception/codeception/codecept build
   ```
   

   
 
4. In order to be able to run acceptance tests you need to start a webserver. The simplest way is to use PHP built in
   webserver. In the root directory where `common`, `frontend` etc. are execute the following:

   ```
   php -S localhost:8080
   ```

5. Now you can run the tests with the following commands, assuming you are in the `tests/codeception` directory:

   ```
   # frontend tests
   cd codeception/frontend
   ../../.../vendor/codeception/codeception/codecept build
   ../../.../vendor/codeception/codeception/codecept run [unit | acceptance | functional]
   
   # backend tests
   cd codeception/backend
   ../../.../vendor/codeception/codeception/codecept build 
   ../../../vendor/codeception/codeception/codecept run [unit | acceptance | functional]
    
   # etc.
   ```

  If you already have run `../vendor/codeception/codeception/codecept build` for each application, you can skip that step and run all tests by a single `../vendor/codeception/codeception/codecept run`.

4. vim tests/codeception/backend/unit.suite.yml
```

            password: ''
```
     
  
## Unit Tests
> To say it again: you don’t need to install PHPUnit to run its tests. Codeception can run them too.
