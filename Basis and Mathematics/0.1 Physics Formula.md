# Damping Force

An ideal mass–spring–damper system with mass m, spring constant k, and viscous damper of damping coefficient c is subject to an oscillatory force

F_s = -kx     (k: spring constant)
F_d = -cv       (F_d: damping force; c: damping coefficient)
    = -cx' = -c * (dy / dx)      (d: delta)

v(t) = dr(t) / dt
a(t) = dv(t) / dt = d^2 * r(t) / dt^2
F = ma      (a: m/s^2)
F_total = ma = mx" =  m * (d^2 * x / d * t^2)
### Damping Ratio
For a damped harmonic oscillator with mass m, damping coefficient c, and spring constant k, it can be defined as the ratio of the damping coefficient in the system's differential equation to the critical damping coefficient:

ζ = c / c_c = actual damping / critical damping    (ζ(zeta): damping;)
